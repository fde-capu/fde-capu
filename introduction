The cathode ray tubes of the TK3000 IIe screen mesmerized me, opening portals to worlds I could craft into game adventures. Later, the transcendent energy of freestyle jam sessions sparkled a love for music and its chaotic yet harmonious nature. Nowadays, I am enthusiastic about AI and Machine Learning to optimize innovative solutions, enhance decision-making and improve user experiences. Yet, beyond technical proficiency, I am also interested in exploring the mysteries of human creativity.

Captivated by the convergence of functional logic and art expression, I pursued studies in both realms. I have earned a Bachelor of Music Composition from FASM University in 2006, having composed an international award winning full-orchestra piece. More recently, in 2023, I have got an equivalent degree in Computer Science as an Human Coder from École 42; a world-wide school of excellence focused in C/C++ that fosters peer reviewing. Currently, I am enrolled in the 42 Advanced specialization program, which covers in-depth a vast spectrum of tech areas.

I enjoy working with others in collaborative environments that encourage learning and knowledge exchange, where I can contribute to collective success. Willing to continue developing interdisciplinary expertise in various domains and technologies, I welcome the opportunity to join any team, in any area of programming, computation and technology.

I am confident that my blend of technical expertise, creative thinking, and passion for innovation would be an valuable asset.

1st draft:

In the pre-Internet 1990s, as a kid, the cathode ray tube's phosphorescent green glow of the TK-3000 screen seemed a mesmerizing portal to worlds I could build line by line into text adventures. Later on, from the raw energy of free-style jam sessions, emerged a love for music and its appealing underlying chaotic syntax. This seemingly disparate pair – the cold functional logic of computer code instructions and the transcendental freedom of artistic expression – became passions that demanded synthesis. With that in mind, I began a personal journey of research to bridge this gap: instilling mathematical precision into music and poetry into code.

I am now a computer science graduate of the École 42, a school that fosters collaborative peer spirit and tackles rigorous challenges of programming. I have meticulously dissected the intricacies of low-level languages, gaining understanding that extends to higher-level frameworks. My true enthusiasm lies beyond technical mastery: it is about unlocking the secrets of human creativity. Neural networks, especially the nonlinear kind that mimic the organic brain, hold great promise. For nowadays, Artificial Intelligence lacks a crucial element: a spark of consciousness. Can music's structure, a language without syntactical meaning, be a key to imbuing AI with the glimmer of sentience? This question drives my inquiry, the space where logic and art dance in a symphony of innovation.

The cathode tubes of the TK3000 IIe screen mesmerized me like a portal into worlds I could craft into game adventures. Later, the ethereal energy of freestyle jam sessions sparkled a love for music and its underlying chaotic yet harmonious nature.

The convergence of functional logic and art expression has grew into a desire to include technical precision into music and poetry into code. I studied both realms, earning a Bachelor of Music Composition from FASM University in 1999 and a degree in Computer Science 'Human Coder' at the École 42, in 2023.

Beyond technical proficiency, I explore the mysteries of human creativity. Neural networks, particularly those inspired by the organic brain, offer possibilities for understanding our cognitive abilities, representing a glimpse into the inner working of our minds.

Despite its current advancements, Artificial Intelligence lacks a crucial element: a spark of consciousness. Could music, a language devoid of syntactical meaning, be the key to imbuing AI with a glimmer of sentience? This question serves as the catalyst for my ongoing inquiry, a space where logic and art intertwine in a symphony of innovation.
