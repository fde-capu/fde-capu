The mesmerizing glow of the cathode ray tubes from the TK3000 IIe screen opened portals to worlds I could craft into game adventures. Later, the transcendent energy of freestyle jam sessions sparkled a love for music and its chaotic yet harmonious nature. Nowadays, I am enthusiastic about AI and Machine Learning to optimize innovative solutions, enhance decision-making and improve creator, developer and user experiences. Beyond technical proficiency, I am also interested in exploring the mysteries of human creativity.

Captivated by the convergence of functional logic and art expression, I pursued studies in both realms. I achieved a Bachelor of Music Composition from FASM University in 2006, having composed an international award winning full-orchestra score. More recently, in 2023, I earned an equivalent degree in Computer Science as "Human Coder" from Ã‰cole 42, a world-wide school of excellence focused in C/C++ based on peer reviewing that fosters collectiveness. Currently, I am enrolled in the 42 Advanced specialization program, which covers in-depth a vast spectrum of tech areas.

I enjoy working with others in collaborative environments that encourage learning and knowledge exchange. Willing to continue developing interdisciplinary expertise in various domains and technologies, I welcome the opportunity to join any team, in any area of programming, computation and technology.

I am confident about my blend of technical and creative thinking - plus passion for innovation.
