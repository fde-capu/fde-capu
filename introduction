The cathode ray tubes of the TK3000 IIe screen mesmerized me, opening portals to worlds I could craft into game adventures. Later, the transcendent energy of freestyle jam sessions sparkled a love for music and its chaotic yet harmonious nature. Nowadays, I am enthusiastic about AI and Machine Learning to optimize innovative solutions, enhance decision-making and improve user experiences. Beyond technical proficiency, I am also interested in exploring the mysteries of human creativity.

Captivated by the convergence of functional logic and art expression, I pursued studies in both realms. I have earned a Bachelor of Music Composition from FASM University in 2006, having composed an international award winning full-orchestra piece. More recently, in 2023, I have got an equivalent degree in Computer Science as an Human Coder from Ã‰cole 42; a world-wide school of excellence focused in C/C++ based on peer reviewing that fosters collectiveness. Currently, I am enrolled in the 42 Advanced specialization program, which covers in-depth a vast spectrum of tech areas.

I enjoy working with others in collaborative environments that encourage learning and knowledge exchange. Willing to continue developing interdisciplinary expertise in various domains and technologies, I welcome the opportunity to join any team, in any area of programming, computation and technology.

I am confident that my blend of technical and creative thinking - plus passion for innovation - is a valuable asset.
