AboutAbout
The mesmerizing glow of the cathode ray tubes from the TK3000 IIe screen opened portals to worlds I could craft into game adventures. Later, the transcendent energy of freestyle jam sessions sparkled a love for music and its chaotic yet harmonious nature. Nowadays, I am enthusiastic about artificial intelligence to optimize solutions, enhance decision-making and improve creator, developer and user experiences. I am technically proficient and interested in exploring the mysteries of human creativity.

Captivated by the convergence of functional logic and art expression, I pursued studies in both realms. I achieved a Bachelor of Music Composition from FASM University in 2006, having composed an international award winning full-orchestra score. More recently, in 2023, I earned an equivalent degree in Computer Science as "Human Coder" from École 42, a world-wide school of excellence focused in C/C++ based on peer reviewing that fosters collectiveness. I am currently enrolled in the 42 Advanced specialization program, which covers in-depth a vast spectrum of tech areas.

I enjoy working in collaborative environments that encourage learning by knowledge exchange. Willing to continue developing interdisciplinary expertises, I welcome opportunities to collaborate with innovative teams, mindful of humanities, through computation and technology exploration.

I am confident about my blend of technical and creative thinking.

    FreelanceFreelance Apr 2017 - Present · 7 yrs 7 mosApr 2017 to Present · 7 yrs 7 mos
            As a developer, I undertake a broad spectrum of projects, from low-level system programming, to I/O operations, to network architecture, web applications, data structures, algorithms, reliability, and performance of software.

            For instance, I have developed a non-blocking web server with full CGI in C++98 using Unix system calls and implementing the HTTP 1.1 protocol, complying to networking terminology and interfaces. Another project, the ray-tracing, is rather a linear algebra computing research. In advanced projects, I have coded a full stack social network, with real time multiplayer game, and explored high level frameworks.

            As study-cases, I have completely rewritten the functions and functionalities of the C standard library and the C++ containers. Also, I have experienced use of multithreading, microservices, Kubernetes, Docker, management and deployment of applications.As a developer, I undertake a broad spectrum of projects, from low-level system programming, to I/O operations, to network architecture, web applications, data structures, algorithms, reliability, and performance of software.
