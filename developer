As a developer, I undertake a broad spectrum of projects, from low-level system programming, to I/O operations, to network architecture, web applications, data structures, algorithms, reliability, and performance of software.

For instance, I have developed a non-blocking web server with full CGI in C++98 using Unix system calls and implementing the HTTP 1.1 protocol, complying to networking terminology and interfaces. Another project, the ray-tracing, is rather a linear algebra computing research. In advanced projects, I have coded a full stack social network, with real time multiplayer game, and explored high level frameworks.

As study-cases, I have completely rewritten the functions and functionalities of the C standard library and the C++ containers. Also, I have experienced use of multithreading, microservices, Kubernetes, Docker, management and deployment of applications.
