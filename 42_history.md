As a developer, I've tackled a broad spectrum of projects, from low-level system programming and I/O operations to network architecture, web applications, data structures, algorithms, reliability and performance of software, as all projects are leak and crash free and developed from scratch, that is, no auxiliary imports.
For instance, I developed a non-blocking web server in C++98 using Unix system calls and implementing the HTTP 1.1 protocol, having understanding of networking terminology, interfaces, and protocols. A raytracing project handles linear algebra, complex templating and file authoring. In advanced projects, I showcase skills in Angular, NestJS, Docker, and PostgreSQL. As study-cases, I have completelly re-written the functions and funcionalities of the C standard library and the C++ containers. Also, I have experienced use of microservices, Kubernetes, Docker, management and deployment of applications.

rl_replace_line, rl_redisplay, add_history,
printf, malloc, free, write, access, open, read,
close, fork, wait, waitpid, wait3, wait4, signal,
sigaction, sigemptyset, sigaddset, kill, exit,
getcwd, chdir, stat, lstat, fstat, unlink, execve,

Final Mark: 100

### ft_services
Kubernetes
Docker (without Docker-Compose)
Microservices
Alpine Linux
nginx
load balancing (MetalLB)
WordPress installation
PhpMyAdmin
MySQL / MariaDB
FTPS
Grafana, InfluxDB
Minikube
Unix users and groups
ssh
Final Mark: 100

### miniRT
Raytracing implementation by pixel basis
The goal of your program is to generate
images using the Raytracing protocol. Those
computer-generated images will each represent a
scene, as seen from a specific angle and position,
defined by simple geometric objects, and each with
its own lighting system.
Linear Algebra
Color theory
x-window
File formatting (saving the bmp image)
Using only these:
• open, close, read, write,
printf, malloc, free, perror,
strerror, exit
• All functions of the math
library (-lm man man 3 math)
pure C language
Final Mark: 105

### push_swap
sorting algorithms
pure C language
no external functions besides read, write, malloc, free, exit
Final Mark: 97

### Philosophers
Multithreading and Mutexes
Semaphores
Concepts about: memset, printf, malloc, free, write,
usleep, gettimeofday, pthread_create,
pthread_detach, pthread_join, pthread_mutex_init,
pthread_mutex_destroy, pthread_mutex_lock,
pthread_mutex_unlock
Final Mark: 100
